## Overview

Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax that can be converted to HTML or
other formats. This package provides wrappers based on the
[commonmark](https://github.com/r-lib/commonmark) package.

Please note that this package is no longer actively developed. New development
will continue only in [the **litedown**
package](https://github.com/yihui/litedown), which is a new implementation of R
Markdown.

## License

The **markdown** package is licensed under MIT.
